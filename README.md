# Rasp-WS2812b
Power WS2812b LEDs from your Raspberry Pi over SPI.

[Blogpost](https://blog.tomarrell.com/post/rust_and_leds)

## How it works?
The LEDs run with a scan frequency of no less than `400Hz`, with a data transfer rate of `800kbps`.

The traditional method of communication with the WS2812b is usually PWM. The duty cycle to send a single bit is:

| Bit | Time High | Time Low | Duty % |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| 0   | 0.4us     | 0.85us   | 32%    |
| 1   | 0.8us     | 0.45us   | 64%    |

A visual of the protocol is below.

```
PWM LED (0): where
    on time  = 0.4us +/-150ns
    off time = 0.85us +/-150ns
    
Volts
    |    START                      END
    |    v                          v
    |    ----------
    |    |        |
    |    |        |
    |    |        |
    | ----        -------------------
    *-------------------------------- Time
    
PWM LED (1): where
   on time  = 0.8us +/-150ns
   off time = 0.45us +/-150ns
   
Volts
    |    START                      END
    |    v                          v
    |    ------------------
    |    |                |
    |    |                |
    |    |                |
    | ----                -----------
    *-------------------------------- Time
```

Looking at the above duty cycle lengths, we can approximate each time slice into another 3 periods, each **33%** of the original wavelength in order to have constant high/low runs for the given period. This will allow us to continue using SPI, using a clock speed of approximately `3Mhz`.

To interact over SPI, each traditional LED sequence (3 bytes, 8 bits per colour channel) needs to be converted to a 9 byte sequence (72 bits per colour channel) before being shifted over SPI. Each traditional PWM 'bit' gets turned into an equivalent 3 SPI bits, and the clock speed of the SPI interface set to achieve within the `+/-150ns` error margins.

With the traditional period broken into 3 time sections, each can be pulled high or low individually. We can therefore represent what would have been a PWM (1) with an SPI `110`. And on the contrary, represent a PWM (0) with an SPI `100`.
